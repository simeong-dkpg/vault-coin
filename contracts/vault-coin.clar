;; VaultCoin Protocol - Next-Generation Yield Optimization Platform
;;
;; Summary: Revolutionary DeFi protocol that transforms idle sBTC into productive
;;          assets through intelligent staking mechanisms and automated yield
;;          distribution, maximizing returns while maintaining Bitcoin's security
;;
;; Description: VaultCoin Protocol introduces a sophisticated staking ecosystem
;;              built on Stacks' Bitcoin Layer 2 infrastructure. Users can
;;              deposit their synthetic Bitcoin (sBTC) into optimized yield
;;              vaults that automatically compound returns through strategic
;;              time-locked positions. The protocol features dynamic reward
;;              algorithms, flexible lock periods, and transparent governance
;;              mechanisms that adapt to market conditions for maximum capital
;;              efficiency.
